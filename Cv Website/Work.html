                    <p>Parralax is a digital agency that designs, creates and publishes the website for people to veiw. I work for Parralax for one week creating one of my own projects, this was to get a feel of what it was like working for a digital agency. This helped me as it increased my knowledge in HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>
